Revision history for Tkx-ROText

0.03  1/8/2009
      Changed widget from being fixed as read-only to supporting 'readonly' as 
      an option for the -state configuration item. The state can now be toggled 
      between readonly (the default), normal, and disabled.

0.02  1/5/2009
      Re-release with revised directory permissions in tar archive to make the 
      CPAN indexer happy.
